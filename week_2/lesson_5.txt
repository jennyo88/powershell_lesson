Practice:
---------------------------------------------------------------------------------
To enhance your error handling and debugging skills in PowerShell, practice the following tasks:

1. Implement error handling in a script:
   - Write a script that attempts to perform a file operation (e.g., copying a file).
   - Use Try/Catch blocks to handle potential errors gracefully.
   - Include error messages and logging to track script execution.

2. Debug a script using Write-Debug:
   - Add Write-Debug statements to a script to output debug information.
   - Run the script with debugging enabled to observe debug messages.

3. Generate a report from script output:
   - Modify an existing script to generate a report in CSV or HTML format.
   - Use Export-Csv or ConvertTo-Html cmdlets to convert script output into a report format.

4. Implement logging in a script:
   - Enhance an existing script with logging functionality.
   - Write script output, errors, and debug information to a log file for analysis.

5. Document a script with comments and help information:
   - Add comments to a script to explain its purpose, logic, and usage.
   - Include help information using comment-based help to provide documentation for users.

By practicing these tasks, you will improve your error handling and debugging skills, making your PowerShell scripts more robust, reliable, and maintainable.
