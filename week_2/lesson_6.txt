Remote Management with PowerShell Remoting
=================================================================================

Overview:
---------------------------------------------------------------------------------
PowerShell Remoting allows you to execute commands on remote computers, making it a powerful tool for managing systems across your network. This lesson will cover the basics of PowerShell Remoting, including enabling remoting, running commands remotely, and managing remote sessions.

Enabling PowerShell Remoting:
---------------------------------------------------------------------------------
  This command configures the local computer to allow remote connections. It starts the WinRM service, sets it to start automatically, and creates a firewall rule to allow inbound remote connections.

  For remote computers, you can enable remoting manually or use Group Policy settings.

Running Commands Remotely:
---------------------------------------------------------------------------------
  Once remoting is enabled, you can use the Invoke-Command cmdlet to execute commands on remote computers.

  Example:
```
    Invoke-Command -ComputerName "RemoteComputer" -ScriptBlock { Get-Process }
```

  This command runs the Get-Process cmdlet on the "RemoteComputer" and returns information about running processes.

  You can specify multiple remote computers by providing an array of computer names. Additionally, you can use the -Credential parameter to specify credentials for authenticating to remote computers.

Managing Remote Sessions:
---------------------------------------------------------------------------------
  PowerShell allows you to establish persistent remote sessions with remote computers, which can be useful for running multiple commands without reconnecting each time.

  Example (Establishing a Remote Session):
```
    $session = New-PSSession -ComputerName "RemoteComputer"
```

  This command establishes a persistent remote session with the "RemoteComputer".

  You can then run commands within the session using the Invoke-Command cmdlet with the -Session parameter.

  Example (Running Commands within a Remote Session):
```
    Invoke-Command -Session $session -ScriptBlock { Get-Service }
```

  To disconnect from a remote session without closing it, you can use the Disconnect-PSSession cmdlet. Later, you can reconnect to the session using the Connect-PSSession cmdlet.

  Example (Disconnecting and Reconnecting to a Remote Session):
```
    Disconnect-PSSession -Session $session
    Connect-PSSession -Session $session
```

  To close a remote session entirely, use the Remove-PSSession cmdlet.

  Example (Closing a Remote Session):
```
    Remove-PSSession -Session $session
```

Practice:
---------------------------------------------------------------------------------
To gain proficiency in PowerShell Remoting, practice the following tasks:

1. Enable PowerShell Remoting on your local computer using the Enable-PSRemoting cmdlet.

2. Run a basic command (e.g., Get-Process) on a remote computer in your network using the Invoke-Command cmdlet.

3. Execute a script remotely on a remote computer. The script should perform a simple task, such as retrieving system information or checking service status.

4. Establish a persistent remote session with a remote computer using the New-PSSession cmdlet and run multiple commands within the session.

5. Disconnect from the remote session without closing it using the Disconnect-PSSession cmdlet, and then reconnect to it later using the Connect-PSSession cmdlet.

6. Close the remote session entirely using the Remove-PSSession cmdlet.

By completing these tasks, you will gain practical experience in using PowerShell Remoting to manage remote computers and automate administration tasks across your network.
