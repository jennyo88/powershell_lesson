Mastering the PowerShell Pipeline
=================================================================================

Overview:
---------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Understanding and effectively utilizing the PowerShell pipeline is essential for writing efficient and concise scripts.
The pipeline allows you to chain commands together, passing the output of one command as the input to another.
This lesson will cover the basics of working with the PowerShell pipeline, including filtering, sorting, and formatting data.

Topics Covered:
---------------------------------------------------------------------------------
1. Introduction to the PowerShell Pipeline:
   - Explanation of what the PowerShell pipeline is and its significance.
   - Understanding how the pipeline enables seamless data flow between cmdlets.

2. Filtering Data in the Pipeline:
   - Using the Where-Object cmdlet to filter data based on specific conditions.
   - Applying filtering criteria to refine the output of commands in the pipeline.

3. Sorting Data in the Pipeline:
   - Utilizing the Sort-Object cmdlet to sort data in ascending or descending order.
   - Sorting data based on one or more properties.

4. Formatting Output in the Pipeline:
   - Formatting the output of commands using the Format-Table, Format-List, and Format-Wide cmdlets.
   - Customizing the appearance and layout of output data.

Practice:
---------------------------------------------------------------------------------
To gain proficiency in using the PowerShell pipeline, practice the following tasks:

1. Filter and customize process information:
   - Use the Get-Process cmdlet to retrieve a list of processes running on your system.
   - Pipe the output to Select-Object to display only the Name and CPU properties for each process.
   - Experiment with different properties and combinations to customize the output according to your requirements.

2. Filter services by status:
   - Use the Get-Service cmdlet to retrieve a list of services installed on your system.
   - Pipe the output to Where-Object to filter services based on their status (e.g., Running or Stopped).
   - Explore different conditions and criteria to selectively process services according to their status.

3. Perform custom actions on files:
   - Use the Get-ChildItem cmdlet to retrieve a list of files in a directory.
   - Pipe the output to ForEach-Object to perform a custom action (e.g., displaying file names) for each file.
   - Experiment with different script blocks and operations to manipulate and process files as needed.

By practicing these tasks, you will become more proficient in using the PowerShell pipeline and leveraging its capabilities to streamline your workflow and automate repetitive tasks effectively.
