|   Working with Services   |
=============================
- Managing services:
  - Services are background processes that run continuously on a computer.
  - PowerShell provides cmdlets like Get-Service, Start-Service, Stop-Service, and Restart-Service for managing services.

    Example:
    - Get a list of all services on the local computer:
      ```powershell
      Get-Service
      ```

- Filtering and sorting services:
  - PowerShell allows you to filter and sort services based on specific criteria using Where-Object and Sort-Object cmdlets.

    Example:
    - Get a list of running services sorted by display name:
      ```powershell
      Get-Service | Where-Object { $_.Status -eq "Running" } | Sort-Object -Property DisplayName
      ```

- Monitoring services:
  - PowerShell enables you to monitor service status and performance, allowing you to take proactive actions as needed.

    Example:
    - Monitor a specific service and restart it if it stops:
      ```powershell
      $service = Get-Service -Name "service_name"
      if ($service.Status -ne "Running") {
          Restart-Service -Name "service_name"
      }
      ```

- Advanced service management:
  - PowerShell provides additional cmdlets and techniques for advanced service management, such as setting service startup type and dependencies.

    Example:
    - Set the startup type of a service to Automatic:
      ```powershell
      Set-Service -Name "service_name" -StartupType Automatic
      ```
