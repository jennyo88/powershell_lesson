|   Remote Management with PowerShell   |
=========================================
- Remoting basics:
  - PowerShell remoting allows you to execute commands on remote computers.
  - It enables remote administration and automation of tasks across multiple machines.

    Example:
    - Enable PowerShell remoting on a remote computer:
      ```powershell
      Enable-PSRemoting -Force
      ```

- Connecting to remote computers:
  - PowerShell provides cmdlets like Enter-PSSession and Invoke-Command for connecting to remote computers and executing commands remotely.

    Example:
    - Enter an interactive remote session with a remote computer:
      ```powershell
      Enter-PSSession -ComputerName "remote_computer"
      ```

- Remote session management:
  - PowerShell allows you to manage remote sessions using cmdlets like Import-PSSession and Remove-PSSession.
  - This enables you to import commands from remote sessions and clean up inactive sessions.

    Example:
    - Import commands from a remote session:
      ```powershell
      Import-PSSession -Session $remoteSession
      ```

- Using PowerShell remoting for automation:
  - PowerShell remoting is a powerful tool for automating administrative tasks across multiple machines.
  - It allows you to execute scripts remotely, manage services, install software, and more.

    Example:
    - Restart a service on a remote computer:
      ```powershell
      Invoke-Command -ComputerName "remote_computer" -ScriptBlock { Restart-Service -Name "service_name" }
      ```

- Security considerations:
  - PowerShell remoting relies on WinRM (Windows Remote Management) for communication, which should be properly configured and secured.
  - Use HTTPS and configure firewall rules to restrict access to trusted hosts.

    Example:
    - Configure WinRM to use HTTPS:
      ```powershell
      New-Item -Path WSMan:\localhost\Service -Name RootSDDL -Value 'O:NSG:BAD:P(A;;GA;;;BA)(A;;GR;;;IU)S:P(AU;FA;GA;;;WD)(AU;SA;GXGW;;;WD)'
      ```
